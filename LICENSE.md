This work is released under the **MIT License** (a permissive open-source license), augmented with academic-oriented guidelines to encourage responsible use, proper attribution, and continuation of the knowledge chain in software-defined networking research and education.

### 📜 I. GRANT OF UNIVERSAL PERMISSIONS (Core MIT Permissions)

All persons and entities — whether for academic research, education, personal experimentation, or commercial purposes — are granted a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license** to:

- Reproduce and copy the SDN topologies, Mininet scripts, Ryu controller applications, and related configuration logic in any form or medium.
- Analyze, deconstruct, and study the inter-VLAN routing mechanisms, flow rules, and controller logic for educational or research purposes.
- Modify, adapt, extend, or integrate this architecture with other network frameworks, protocols, or intellectual property.
- Distribute original or modified versions through GitHub, GitLab, academic repositories, conference proceedings, theses, or any other channel.
- Sublicense the code (with or without modifications) under compatible terms.

### 🔐 II. COVENANTS & PRESERVATION OBLIGATIONS

**Article 2.1 – Attribution & Provenance Integrity**  
Every copy, substantial portion, or derivative work **must** retain:

- The original copyright notice:  
  `Copyright © 2024–2026 gustavomoers & M-Amin-Khodadadi`
- This full license text (or at minimum the standard MIT permission paragraph below)
- Clear acknowledgment of the dual authorship and RIB University project origin

Failure to preserve this provenance chain undermines academic integrity and violates the conditions of use.

**Article 2.2 – Version & Branching Clarity**  
Modified versions **should** be clearly labeled as:

- “Evolved iteration”, “Fork”, “Extended version”, “RIB-Nexus-v2”, etc.
- While preserving reference to the original baseline project name and repository (if public).

This convention helps maintain traceability in the academic and research community.

### ⚖️ III. LIMITATIONS & DISCLAIMER (Standard MIT + Explicit SDN Context)

**Section 3.1 – AS-IS Provision – No Warranties**  
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  

In the context of network simulation: no warranty is made regarding packet forwarding performance, absence of loops, scalability on real hardware, compatibility with specific OpenFlow versions, Ryu stability under high load, or suitability for production environments.

**Section 3.2 – Liability Shield**  
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.  

This includes (but is not limited to):

- Simulated or real packet loss, forwarding blackholes, broadcast storms, or routing inconsistencies
- Controller crashes, Mininet topology failures, or resource exhaustion during emulation
- Any consequences from integrating with third-party SDN controllers, switches, or physical testbeds

### 🧬 IV. SYNERGY & ACADEMIC MANIFESTO

This SDN framework is offered as a building block in the continuum of networking education and innovation. By using, extending, or teaching with this code, you become part of a collaborative chain that began in a university classroom and can extend to future research, industry prototypes, or next-generation network designs.

**Corollary 4.1 – Encouraged Reciprocity** (non-binding aspiration)  
While not a legal requirement, we strongly encourage users — especially future RIB University students, researchers, and alumni — to:

- Share improvements and new features back to the community (via forks, pull requests, or publications)
- Cite the original project in academic papers, theses, or presentations
- Continue the spirit of open knowledge exchange in software-defined networking

### 🔭 Closing Thought

From dual student origins at RIB University → to infinite network simulation possibilities.  
Your innovation, extension, or teaching use becomes the next link in the chain.

Happy SDN experimenting!
